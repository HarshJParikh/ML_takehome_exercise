# 🚀 Multi-Task Learning for Sentiment Analysis & Intent Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **multi-task learning (MTL) model** for:
1. **Sentiment Analysis** → Predicts whether a sentence is **positive or negative**.
2. **Intent Detection** → Classifies a sentence into one of four intent categories:  
   - **Question**
   - **Statement**
   - **Command**
   - **Request**

The model is based on **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** from `sentence-transformers` and is trained using **synthetic datasets**.
